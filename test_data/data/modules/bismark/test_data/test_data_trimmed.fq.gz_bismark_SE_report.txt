Bismark report for: test_data_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.14.0)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie against the bisulfite genome of /pica/v12/b2013064_nobackup/phil/bismark_references/Homo_sapiens/Ensembl/GRCh37/Sequence/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --phred33-quals -n 1 -k 2 --best --chunkmbs 512

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	9184
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	6025
Mapping efficiency:	65.6%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	1891
Sequences did not map uniquely:	1268
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	3012	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	3013	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
