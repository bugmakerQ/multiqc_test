Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 3754 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
2665 reads were unassignable (70.99%)
612 reads were specific for genome 1 (16.30%)
476 reads were specific for genome 2 (12.68%)
379 reads that were unassignable contained C>T SNPs preventing the assignment
2 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.05%)
1 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.03%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	../all_SNPs_CAST_EiJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20668547
N-containing reads:	1469
non-N:			2284
total:			3754
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	1 (0.03%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	0

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	2296 (100.00%)
Positions were skipped since they involved C>T SNPs:	774
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		0 (0.00%)
