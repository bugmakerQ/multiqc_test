Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 4592 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
2993 reads were unassignable (65.18%)
863 reads were specific for genome 1 (18.79%)
731 reads were specific for genome 2 (15.92%)
2 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.04%)
5 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.11%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	../all_SNPs_CAST_EiJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20668547
N-containing reads:	1599
non-N:			2991
total:			4592
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	2 (0.04%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	0

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	2505 (100.00%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		0 (0.00%)
