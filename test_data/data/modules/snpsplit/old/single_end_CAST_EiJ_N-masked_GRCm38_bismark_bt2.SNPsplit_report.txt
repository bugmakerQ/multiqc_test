Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 1967 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
1420 reads were unassignable (72.19%)
294 reads were specific for genome 1 (14.95%)
251 reads were specific for genome 2 (12.76%)
199 reads that were unassignable contained C>T SNPs preventing the assignment
0 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.00%)
2 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.10%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	../all_SNPs_CAST_EiJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20668547
N-containing reads:	745
non-N:			1221
total:			1967
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	1 (0.05%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	0

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	1139 (100.00%)
Positions were skipped since they involved C>T SNPs:	389
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		0 (0.00%)
