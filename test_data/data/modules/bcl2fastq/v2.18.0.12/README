The expected behaviour when running multiqc in this directory is:
 - The results from all json files are combined in a single report
 - The run id is not prepended to the sample names so Small_Stats and Small_FakeNewRun are considered to be the same sample
 - When the same runId/lane combination is encountered multiple times it is overwritten (happens for Small_Duplicate)
 - When a sample is in a different lane it is combined with the same sample from other lanes (happens for Small_FakeNewLane) even if they are spread over multiple files
