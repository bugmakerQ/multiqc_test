# bustools 0.40.0

The inspect.json file was generated with the kb-python wrapper. This tool wraps around kallisto and bustools to make scRNA preprocessing easier. The wrapper automatically outputs a `inspect.json` file. To generate this file with bustools you'd have to use `bustools inspect --output inspect.json {mybusfile}`.
