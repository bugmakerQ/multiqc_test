# biobambam2 bamsormadup

Note that this "module" is a special case.
Technically, there is no biobambam2 MultiQC module. But the output from
bamsormadup is so similar to Picard MarkDuplicates that this module handles
both outputs. There is just enough of a difference to differentiate the two tools
and change the report section title.
